# GradientSample

I've been working with iOS for quiet a long time now and believe me, building a nice-looking visual interface is must for an app to get accepted by a larger audience.  Good design, colors, concept everything matters when building a great UI. 
Gradients is one of the things that adds life to the colors.

Ofcourse the second one. Isn't it? Mixing 2 colors is much more appealing than a single color. 
In this article, we'll be discussing how to get that working in our own app. And trust me, it's as easy as it seems to be. "Some more colors instead of a single one". So, let's begin then.
